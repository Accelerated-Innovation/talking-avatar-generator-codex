# Technology Stack

This document defines the approved technology stack for this repository.

All contributors and AI agents must follow these standards when selecting libraries, frameworks, or infrastructure.

New technologies require an **ADR** before use.

---

# 1. Primary Language

**Python**

Approved version:
`Python 3.11+`

Rules:

- Type hints required for public interfaces
- Prefer `dataclasses` or `pydantic` models for structured data
- Avoid dynamic typing in domain logic
- Static typing should support maintainability and clarity

---

# 2. Architecture Model

This repository uses **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**.

Core layers:
```
api/       → inbound adapters (HTTP interfaces)
ports/     → inbound and outbound interfaces
services/  → domain logic and orchestration
adapters/  → infrastructure implementations
common/    → shared utilities and types
```


Rules:

- Domain code must remain framework-agnostic
- Adapters may depend on infrastructure libraries
- Ports define contracts between layers
- Direct dependency between adapters is prohibited

See:
```
docs/backend/architecture/ARCH_CONTRACT.md
docs/backend/architecture/BOUNDARIES.md
```


---

# 3. API Framework

Approved framework:
`FastAPI`
`FastAPI + Jinja2 + SQLite`
`Python 3.11+`
`Pydantic + SQLAlchemy`
`Pillow + httpx + python-multipart`
`pytest + pytest-bdd + pytest-mock`

Supporting libraries:

- `uvicorn`

Rules:

- API layer is an **inbound adapter**
- Route handlers must call **inbound ports**
- Domain logic must never depend on FastAPI
- OpenAPI documentation must be generated automatically

API conventions are defined in:
```
docs/backend/architecture/API_CONVENTIONS.md
``` 

---

# 4. Agent Frameworks

This repository supports AI-driven features.

Approved orchestration frameworks:
```
LangGraph
LangChain (limited use)
```


### LangGraph

Primary framework for agent orchestration.

Used for:

- multi-step reasoning
- tool execution
- stateful workflows
- deterministic agent graphs

### LangChain

Allowed for:

- model wrappers
- prompt templates
- lightweight utilities

Avoid using LangChain for complex orchestration.

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Use | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Single LLM call with structured output | Direct provider SDK (Anthropic, OpenAI) | No orchestration needed; avoids unnecessary abstraction |
| Prompt template with variable substitution | LangChain `PromptTemplate` | Lightweight utility; no orchestration |
| Sequential tool calls (> 2 steps) | LangGraph | Stateful graph manages step ordering and error recovery |
| Branching logic based on LLM output | LangGraph | Conditional edges are a graph concern, not a chain concern |
| Multi-turn conversation with memory | LangGraph | State persistence across turns requires graph checkpointing |
| Parallel tool execution | LangGraph | Fan-out/fan-in is a graph pattern |
| Simple model wrapper (retry, fallback) | LangChain or direct SDK | Either is acceptable; prefer direct SDK for fewer dependencies |
| RAG pipeline (retrieve → augment → generate) | LangGraph if > 2 steps; direct SDK if simple | Simple RAG can be a single function; complex RAG benefits from graph structure |

**Default rule:** If the task requires more than two sequential LLM interactions or any branching, use LangGraph. Otherwise, prefer the direct provider SDK.

---

# 4a. LLM Gateway (Level 5)

Approved LLM gateway:
```
LiteLLM
```

**LiteLLM is the sole LLM gateway.** All LLM completion and chat requests must route through LiteLLM. No direct provider SDK calls are permitted for inference.

LiteLLM provides:

- Model routing and provider abstraction
- Fallback chains and retry logic
- Cost tracking and budget enforcement
- Rate limiting and load balancing

Rules:

- LiteLLM client lives in `adapters/llm/` — an outbound adapter
- Domain services call `LLMPort`, never LiteLLM directly
- Provider SDKs (`openai`, `anthropic`) must not be imported outside `adapters/llm/`
- When using LangGraph/LangChain, LLM calls must route through LiteLLM

Full contract: `docs/backend/architecture/LLM_GATEWAY_CONTRACT.md`

---

# 5. LLM Providers

Providers must be accessed through **adapter layers**.

Examples:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Azure OpenAI
- local models

Rules:

- Provider clients must live in `adapters/`
- Domain logic must never call LLM APIs directly
- Prompt templates must be versioned

---

# 6. Persistence

Approved persistence adapters:
```
PostgreSQL (via SQLAlchemy)
Redis (for caching and ephemeral state)
PGVector (for vector search)
Supabase (PostgreSQL via Supabase client)
```

Rules:

- Repositories must implement outbound ports
- Domain layer must not depend on ORM libraries
- Transactions must be handled in adapters

---

# 7. Messaging and Events

Approved messaging technologies:

- Kafka
- AWS SNS/SQS
- internal event buses

Rules:

- Messaging must be implemented through adapters
- Domain events must not depend on messaging libraries

---

# 8. Testing Stack

Primary testing tools:
```
pytest
pytest-bdd
httpx (for API integration tests)
pytest-mock (for dependency mocking)
```

Test categories:

- unit tests
- BDD integration tests
- contract tests

Testing must follow the rules defined in:
```
docs/backend/architecture/TESTING.md
``` 

---

# 9. Development Tooling

Approved development tools include:
```
Ruff
SonarQube
Snyk
import-linter
pre-commit
```

These tools may be used by AI coding agents during planning and implementation to:

- detect structural complexity
- identify duplicated logic
- enforce architecture boundaries
- detect security vulnerabilities
- enforce linting and formatting rules

Tool findings should be treated as **blocking signals** when they violate project policies.

Configuration for these tools typically lives in:
```
pyproject.toml
.snyk
sonar-project.properties
.github/workflows/
```
Agent interaction rules for development tools are defined in:

`docs/backend/architecture/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`

---

# 10. Evaluation Framework

AI behavior evaluation is required when features use LLMs.

Evaluation standards and tooling:
```
docs/backend/evaluation/eval_criteria.md   ← what must be evaluated (non-negotiable)
docs/backend/evaluation/EVAL_STACK.md      ← approved tools and pipeline by environment
```

Feature-level configuration:
```
features/<feature_name>/eval_criteria.yaml
```

Evaluation includes:

- groundedness checks
- safety validation
- structural correctness
- CI evaluation gates

---

# 10a. LLM Evaluation (Level 5)

Approved LLM evaluation tools:
```
DeepEval      — feature-level quality evaluation (dev + CI)
Promptfoo     — adversarial and regression testing (CI)
RAGAS         — retrieval-specific evaluation (CI, RAG features only)
```

| Tool | Sole Responsibility |
|------|-------------------|
| DeepEval | Quality metrics: faithfulness, answer relevancy, hallucination, contextual relevancy |
| Promptfoo | Safety metrics: jailbreak resistance, prompt injection, adversarial robustness |
| RAGAS | Retrieval metrics: context recall, context precision, answer correctness |

Rules:

- DeepEval is required for all features with `mode: llm`
- Promptfoo is required for user-facing features or features processing untrusted input
- RAGAS is required only for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) features
- These tools complement FIRST/Virtues — they do not replace them

Full contract: `docs/backend/architecture/EVALUATION_LLM_CONTRACT.md`

# 11. Observability

Approved tools:

- structured logging (`structlog`)
- metrics (`opentelemetry-sdk` + Prometheus exporter)
- distributed tracing (`opentelemetry-sdk`)

### Structured Logging

Use `structlog` for all application logging.

Rules:

- All log entries must be structured JSON in production
- logs must include `request_id`, `service`, and `layer` fields
- Domain layer may log domain events only — no infrastructure data
- Adapters may log infrastructure details (query times, connection errors, etc.)
- Use `structlog.get_logger(__name__)` — never `print()` or bare `logging`

### OpenTelemetry

Use `opentelemetry-sdk` to unify logs, metrics, and traces into a single pipeline exported to **Datadog** via the Datadog Agent (OTLP ingestion).

Approved packages:
```
opentelemetry-sdk
opentelemetry-api
opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi
opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```

Rules:

- All three signals (logs, metrics, traces) are exported via `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` → Datadog Agent
- `opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging` bridges `structlog` into the OTel log pipeline — no separate log shipper needed
- FastAPI instrumentation is automatic via `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`
- Adapters must emit spans for all external calls (DB, LLM, vector store)
- Domain services must not import OpenTelemetry directly — use an observability port
- Trace context (`trace_id`, `span_id`) is automatically injected into log entries via OTel logging bridge

### Observability Port

An outbound port (`ObservabilityPort`) must abstract logging and tracing from the domain:

- Domain calls port methods (e.g., `record_event`, `start_span`)
- Adapter implements the port using `structlog` + OpenTelemetry
- This keeps the domain layer infrastructure-agnostic (per architecture contract)

### LLM Observability (Level 5)

Approved LLM-specific observability:
```
OpenLLMetry    — LLM telemetry emission (auto-instruments LiteLLM)
Langfuse       — trace storage, prompt versioning, production dashboards
```

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| OpenLLMetry | Emits OpenTelemetry spans with LLM-specific attributes (model, tokens, cost, latency) |
| Langfuse | Receives and stores traces, provides prompt management, evaluation dashboards |

Rules:

- OpenLLMetry and Langfuse SDK imports restricted to `adapters/observability/`
- OpenLLMetry auto-instruments LiteLLM at startup — no manual span creation for LLM calls
- Langfuse replaces LangSmith and Arize from the previous stack

Full contract: `docs/backend/architecture/OBSERVABILITY_LLM_CONTRACT.md`

# 11a. Runtime Guardrails (Level 5)

Approved guardrail tools:
```
NeMo Guardrails    — conversational safety (dialog flow, topic boundaries, jailbreak prevention)
Guardrails AI      — structured output validation (schema enforcement on LLM responses)
```

| Tool | Sole Responsibility |
|------|-------------------|
| NeMo Guardrails | Behavioral safety — what the LLM is allowed to discuss and how |
| Guardrails AI | Structural correctness — whether LLM output matches the expected schema |

Rules:

- Both tools live in `adapters/guardrails/`
- Neither may be imported in domain or service layers
- Guardrail mode (`nemo`, `guardrails-ai`, `both`, `none`) is declared in architecture preflight

Full contract: `docs/backend/architecture/GUARDRAILS_CONTRACT.md`

---

# 12. Static Analysis and Quality Gates

See Section 9 for approved tools. Rules enforced by those tools:

- architecture boundaries (`import-linter`)
- security issues (`Snyk`)
- duplication and complexity limits (`SonarQube`)
- formatting and linting (`Ruff` via `pre-commit`)

---

# 13. Dependency Rules

Approved dependency sources:

- PyPI
- internally approved packages

Prohibited:

- unmaintained libraries

ADR template:
```
docs/backend/architecture/ADR/TEMPLATE.md
```

---

# 16. Customization for New Projects

New projects using this template should review and customize:

- LLM provider configuration
- persistence technology
