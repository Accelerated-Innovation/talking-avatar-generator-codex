## Evaluation Compliance Summary (MANDATORY)

Predicted BEFORE implementation begins. All score and evidence fields must be populated — null values are not permitted at plan finalization.

```yaml
evaluation_prediction:
  first:
    fast:           { score: null, evidence: "" }
    isolated:       { score: null, evidence: "" }
    repeatable:     { score: null, evidence: "" }
    self_verifying: { score: null, evidence: "" }
    timely:         { score: null, evidence: "" }
    average: null
  virtues:
    working:   { score: null, evidence: "" }
    unique:    { score: null, evidence: "" }
    simple:    { score: null, evidence: "" }
    clear:     { score: null, evidence: "" }
    easy:      { score: null, evidence: "" }
    developed: { score: null, evidence: "" }
    brief:     { score: null, evidence: "" }
    average: null
  thresholds_met: null   # true | false — set to false triggers plan revision
```

### Refactor Triggers Identified

- Structural complexity risks:
- Duplication risks:
- Boundary risks:
- Test fragility risks:

If `thresholds_met` is false or any average is below 4.0, this plan must be revised before implementation begins.

## Increments

Each increment should represent a single, committable unit of work.

- Target ~300 lines of production code per increment
- If an increment exceeds this or spans multiple architectural layers, split it
- Each increment = one atomic commit
- Commit message format: `feat(<feature>): increment N — <increment name>`

### Increment 1: <name>
